Project 2 - Naive Bayes

To run:
Part 1: Deline_Zent_A2_Part1 > Run > Read through answers in cells
Part 2: Deline_Zent_A2_Part2 > Run All > Read through answers in cells

Input: 
All the spam names and spam data csv files are in the input. 

Output:
If you are unable to run the code for any reason, I printed the output I was getting with the heat map for features, the evaluation metrics, and auc plot just to prove it was printing some output here. 

Things I would do better if I had more time:
I wish I had enough time to do the extra-credit, but unfortunately, this assignment was very hard for me with the python syntax and I was stuck just implementing basic answers even after working on this for extensive hours each day. Additionally, when I try to alternate some bins and the amount of features to calculate probabilities with, it sometimes breaks and I wasn't able to figure out why some numbers break it while most other numbers were okay. If I could I'd add this with more time. 

This assignment was difficult but I learned a lot, thank you!
